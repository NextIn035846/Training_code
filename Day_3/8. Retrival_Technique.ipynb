    "### What Are Retrievers?\n",
    "Retrievers are components in LangChain designed to fetch relevant documents from a data source in response to a user’s query\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: User’s query\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process: Searching a data source for documents relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output: Multiple relevant document objects (LangChain document objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data source can be anything, such as a vector store or an API. Internally, retrievers act like search engines, scanning the data source to identify the most relevant documents and returning them to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points about retrievers in LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is not just one retriever; multiple retrievers exist for different use cases.\n",
    "2. All retrievers in LangChain are “runnables,” meaning they have an invoke function and can be plugged into chains, enhancing system flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Retrievers\n",
    "Retrievers can be categorized in two main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on Data Source:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wikipedia Retriever: Queries Wikipedia API to fetch relevant articles based on keywords in the user’s query. It uses keyword matching rather than semantic or syntactic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector Store Retriever: Fetches relevant documents from vector databases like Chroma or FAISS. It performs semantic search using embeddings, comparing query and document vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Archive Retriever: Searches research papers or documents from archive websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Based on Retrieval Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    " Different retrievers use different search mechanisms to find relevant documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) Retriever: Balances relevance and diversity in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-Query Retriever: Breaks down ambiguous queries into multiple clearer queries and merges results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contextual Compression Retriever: Compresses documents after retrieval to keep only relevant content based on the query."

We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself.

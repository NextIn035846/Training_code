    "A LangChain prompt template is a reusable way to build prompts for language models. It gives you a clear structure to follow, while making it easy to customize prompts and save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChainâ€™s templates help keep your prompts consistent, and make the modelâ€™s answers more predictable and reliable. Over time, they also improve results by reducing randomness in how prompts are written.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt template usually consists of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A text prompt, which is just a chunk of natural language. It can be plain text, or it can have placeholders like {variable} that get filled in with real values when you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optional formatting rules, so you can control how the final prompt looks, like whether text should be bold, in all caps, or styled a certain way."

The main ones include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting or diarrhea, especially in kids. I should probably list these out clearly.\n",

Also, fever is a key differentiator. Oh, and it's important to note that not everyone with the flu will have a fever, but it's common.\n",

      "- **Fever** (often high, 100Â°F/38Â°C or higher) â€“ though not everyone with the flu has a fever.\n",

      "- **Fatigue or weakness** (can last up to 2 weeks).\n",
      "- **Loss of appetite**.\n",

      "- **Persistent vomiting**.\n",
      "- **Worsening symptoms** after initial improvement (could signal a secondary infection like pneumonia).\n",

      "- Avoid spreading the virus (stay home, wash hands, cover coughs).\n",

I should check if there's a nuance in their question. The user might be looking for a more comprehensive list or want to know about less common symptoms. Let me recall the flu symptoms thoroughly.\\n\\nThe flu typically presents with fever, which is a high one, often above 100.4Â°F. Then there's the cough, which can be dry or productive. Body aches are indeed common, sometimes severe. They might also experience chills, which weren't mentioned before. Other symptoms include sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue, and sometimes headaches. Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea can occur, especially in children. \\n\\nWait, in my previous answer, I mentioned fever, cough, and body aches. Now the user is asking again, maybe they want a more detailed list. I should make sure to include all the common symptoms and note that some people might not get a fever. Also, it's important to differentiate between flu and a common cold since symptoms can overlap. \\n\\nI should structure the response clearly, list the main symptoms, maybe mention that symptoms come on suddenly, and note any additional points like contagiousness. Let me double-check medical sources to confirm. Yes, the CDC lists those symptoms. Also, it's good to mention that severe cases can lead to complications like pneumonia. \\n\\nSo, the user might be trying to assess if they or someone they know has the flu. They need a thorough but concise answer. I'll present the main symptoms, some additional ones, and maybe a note on when to seek medical help. Let me make sure the response is accurate and helpful without being redundant.

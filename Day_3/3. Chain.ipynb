    "### What Exactly is a \"Chain\" in LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest terms, a Chain is a sequence of calls. Think of it as an assembly line for your AI application. Instead of just one worker (a single LLM call), you have a series of workers, each performing a specific task in a set order. This allows you to build more sophisticated and coherent applications by combining multiple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building an app to help you plan a trip. A single LLM call might give you a generic itinerary. But with a Chain, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Take the user's destination and find the top attractions (first LLM call).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Take that list of attractions and find the best local restaurants near them (second LLM call, using the output from step 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Take the restaurant list and generate a sample dinner menu (third LLM call).\n",
    "\n",
    "See how the output from one step seamlessly becomes the input for the next? Thatâ€™s the magic of Chains! They allow you to break down a complex task into smaller, manageable steps."

      "Here are 5 interesting facts about cricket:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Test Matches Can Last Up to Five Days (and Still Be a Draw):** Unlike most other major sports, a single Test match in cricket is designed to be played over five consecutive days, with each team batting twice. Even after all that time, the game can still end in a draw if a winner isn't decided by the end of the fifth day!\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Sir Donald Bradman's Unbreakable Record:** Australian legend Sir Donald Bradman holds the most incredible batting average in Test cricket: **99.94**. To put that in perspective, the next best average for a player with a significant career is typically in the low 60s. He famously needed just 4 runs in his final innings to average 100 but was bowled for a duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **A Language of its Own:** Cricket boasts some of the most unique and whimsical terminology in sports. Ever heard of a 'googly,' a 'chinaman,' a 'silly mid-off,' a 'nightwatchman,' a 'ducks' egg,' or a 'sticky wicket'? These are all legitimate terms used in the game, often adding to its charm and mystique.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **The World's Second Most Popular Sport:** While not as globally ubiquitous as football (soccer), cricket is widely considered the second most popular sport in the world, with an estimated 2.5 billion fans. Its massive following is primarily concentrated in the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), Australia, England, South Africa, and the Caribbean.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **The Ball is Seriously Hard (and Dangerous):** A cricket ball is solid cork, tightly wound with string, and covered in leather. It weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (155.9 to 163 grams) and is incredibly hard. Professional bowlers can propel it at speeds exceeding 90 mph (145 km/h), making protective gear like helmets, pads, and gloves absolutely essential for batsmen and close-in fielders.\n",

      "Here's a 5-pointer summary of the provided report on unemployment in India:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Persistent & Multifaceted Challenge:** Unemployment in India is a complex issue marked by high rates among youth and educated individuals, critically low female labour force participation, and widespread underemployment within the dominant informal sector, indicating a problem of job quality and adequacy, not just joblessness.\n",
      "2.  **Key Structural Causes:** Major drivers include significant skill mismatches between the workforce and industry demands, slow formal sector job creation despite economic growth, the overwhelming dominance of the low-productivity informal sector, and the immense pressure from a large, continuously growing youth cohort entering the workforce.\n",
      "3.  **Severe Economic & Social Impacts:** High unemployment leads to substantial economic losses in productivity and GDP, increased fiscal burden on the government, and reduced consumption. Socially, it exacerbates poverty and inequality, can fuel unrest, and causes mental health issues and forced migration.\n",
      "4.  **Government Initiatives & Implementation Gaps:** The Indian government has launched numerous initiatives like Skill India, Make in India, MUDRA, PLI schemes, and MGNREGA to promote employment and entrepreneurship. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by implementation challenges, a continued focus on job quantity over quality, and difficulties in formalizing the vast informal sector.\n",
      "5.  **Multi-Pronged Strategy Required:** Addressing the issue necessitates a comprehensive approach, including accelerating formal sector growth (especially in manufacturing and MSMEs), revamping skill development to align with industry needs, strengthening social security measures, promoting entrepreneurship, and implementing targeted policies to boost female labour force participation.\n",

      "## Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Consolidated Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful set of supervised learning methods primarily used for **classification**, **regression**, and **outlier detection**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advantages of SVMs\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces:** SVMs perform well even when dealing with a large number of features (dimensions), including situations where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
      "*   **Memory Efficient:** They achieve memory efficiency by using only a subset of the training points, known as \"support vectors,\" in their decision function.\n",
      "*   **Versatile Kernel Functions:** SVMs are highly versatile due to their ability to use various \"Kernel functions,\" which can be customized to suit different data types and complex relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disadvantages of SVMs\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Risk of Overfitting:** There is a risk of overfitting, especially when the number of features significantly outweighs the number of samples. This requires careful selection and tuning of Kernel functions and regularization parameters.\n",
      "*   **No Direct Probability Estimates:** SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates. While these can be calculated, it typically involves computationally expensive methods like five-fold cross-validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Input (Scikit-learn Specifics)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Supported Formats:** Support Vector Machines in scikit-learn are designed to handle both dense (`numpy.ndarray`) and sparse (`scipy.sparse`) sample vectors as input.\n",
      "*   **Optimal Performance:** For best performance, it is recommended to use specific data types, such as `float64`.\n",
